qpm - qDot's Portfolio Manager
==============================

There's a lot of times I can't remember what the hell it is I do.
Apparently keeping a portfolio is a good way to let both yourself and
others remember what the hell it is you do.

Of course, if I were a painter, it'd just be like, paintings. But no,
I'm a special digital snowflake, so I apparently have to write code to
maintain my self hatred.

This is that code.

The main goal of this is to have a set of scripts that can easily set
up a template directory for all media I might create in the progress
of a project. It should also keep descriptions and relevant
information, pull/update code repositories as necessary, and pop out
websites or PDFs or whatever else on the other end when needed to hand
to other people so they give me money or residencies or jobs or all of
the above.

A lot of files don't really exist in a repo nicely, nor do I need
versioning on a lot of it. The aim is to keep everything in a
homogenous setup that I can then backup to drives/crashplan/whatever
else or access when I need it.

It is not expected that anyone else will use this, ever. I'm not even
sure why I'm writing this README. I guess you just start on these
things and they kinda go their own way.
